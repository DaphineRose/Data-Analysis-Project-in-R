# Data-Analysis-Project-in-R

This project focuses on analyzing data in R. I have worked with data from the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS), an annual salary of 3.5 million housing units by the US Census Bureau to analyse property taxes in the North East in 2016 using property_taxes_2016.csv data set.
